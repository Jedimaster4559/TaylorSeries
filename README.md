# TaylorSeries
A Java package full of tools for creating Taylor Series Approximations. It is designed in such a way that this class can be copy and pasted
into any java project folder. Then you can create a new TaylorSeries object and perform any desired operations!

## Current Project Status
We are currently developing this project. When it will compile, we will modify this to show completion.

## Notes for Devs
##### Taylor Series to add:
- [x] geometric series
- [ ] e
- [ ] square root
- [ ] natural log
- [ ] all trig
Please add to this list as we come across more.</br>

##### Methods to add
- [x] Factorial</br>
- [x] power<br/>
- [x] getter methods for private instance variables</br>
- [ ] add constructor that takes in int as an accuracy level
- [x] reset
- [ ] tester class
- [ ] increased number of tests for each method (tester class) to ensure functionality (5+)
- [ ] rounding class?
- [ ] add new constructors for BigDecimal

##### Methods to test logic and functionality
- [ ] geometric series</br>
- [ ] constructor involving double and int input
- [x] consider changing to allow for more decimal places through BigDecimal or float

##### Problems to fix
- [x] condense the geometric series methods down to one method.
- [x] Add javadocs to the geometric series method(s)
- [x] Clean isAccurate() method to use division
- [ ] Check the usage of the center variable. Should it even be used?
- [x] Add javadocs to all of the getter methods
- [x] Clean geometric series methods to involve the power method.
- [ ] Add javadocs to Tester Methods
- [ ] At least add userinput
- [ ] modify testers so they decrease output messages when a whole series passes or fails

##### Random Ideas we might add
-Graphing functionality</br>
-potentially a GUI?
