# TaylorSeries
A Java package full of tools for creating Taylor Series Approximations. This project has been designed such that 
it does not implement the Math class at all. It is designed in such a way that this class can be copy and pasted
into any java project folder. Then you can create a new TaylorSeries object and perform any desired operations!

## Current Project Status
We are currently developing this project. When it will compile, we will modify this to show completion.

## Notes for Devs
##### Taylor Series to add:
- [x] geometric series
- [ ] e
- [ ] square root
- [ ] natural log
- [ ] all trig
Please add to this list as we come across more.</br>

##### Methods to add
- [x] Factorial</br>
- [x] power<br/>
- [x] getter methods for private instance variables</br>
- [ ] add constructor that takes in int as an accuracy level
- [x] reset
- [ ] tester class

##### Methods to test logic and functionality
- [ ] geometric series</br>
- [ ] constructor involving double and int input

##### Problems to fix
- [x] condense the geometric series methods down to one method.
- [x] Add javadocs to the geometric series method(s)
- [ ] Clean isAccurate() method to use division
- [ ] Check the usage of the center variable. Should it even be used?
- [x] Add javadocs to all of the getter methods
- [ ] Clean geometric series methods to involve the power method.

##### Random Ideas we might add
-Graphing functionality</br>
-potentially a GUI?
